# EyeTester👁️

Is an OOP university project for which I was awarded the maximum grade.

I chose this project, because I wanted to create an app that would actually do something and even help people.
## What does EyeTester do ?🤷
As the name suggests, it tests eyes😆.

More formally explained, Eyetester is an application for Colorblindness testing using Ishihara Plates.

## Technologies used⚙️

### JavaFX
- Used as the Graphical User Interface
### JPA
- Persisted the data of the app
### Hibernate
- Used as the JPA provider
### MySQL
- Managed the database
### JUnit 
- Unit Tested the application

## How to use🕵️
### Step 1: Signing up or Logging in🔓🔑
When opened the app prompts the user with an Login screen, if the user does not have an account, one can be created by clicking the Sign Up button in the top-right corner.
### Step 2: Taking a series of Ishihara tests
#### What is an Ishihara test ?! 🤨
An Ishihara test consists of an Ishihara plate ( an colorful circle with an number inside, the color of the number being hard to see for colorblind people ) and two number choices, one correct the other one wrong, also of a choice that states not seeing anything at all.
### Step 3: Getting the result✅
After the user finishes the tests, a result will be shown.

The possible results are:
- Healthy
- Mildly Colorblind
- Colorblind

### Step 4: Taking another series of tests or quiting🔄️🆚🏁
If the user thinks that the result is not correct, another series of Ishihara tests can be taken, as many times as the user wishes.

On the other hand, if the user thinks that the result fits his condition or just wants to terminate the app, by clicking on the Finish button, the condition of the user being persisted into the database.
